Introducing TELEBOT, a (partially) 3D printed telepresence robot we made out of junk we found in my closet.

Simply inject your friends' consciousnesses into the robot using a standard 3.5mm audio cable, then enjoy some quality time - face to face!

After possessing the robot, your friends can choose from one of three customization options (wizard hat, cowboy hat, or top hat) to really give it that "personal touch".

And, as an added bonus, TELEBOT glows in the dark.
Now, with TELEBOT, your friends can keep you company... even at night!
